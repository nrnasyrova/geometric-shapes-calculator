# Geometric Shapes Calculator

This library provides functionality to calculate area of all geometric shapes.
Currently, it consists of two implemented shapes:
1. Circle
2. Triangle

Moreover, it includes interfaces:

- ICircle - interface for Circle class that includes CalculateDiameter method
- ITriangle - interface for Triangle class that includes a method to check if a triangle is right and a method to calculate perimeter

Furthermore, one can extend a library and add additional geometric shapes and methods by implementing IShape interface.
